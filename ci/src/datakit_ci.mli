(** Datakit CI

    [Datakit_ci] is a library to describe reproducible, cachable and
    distributed computations. The library is specialiazed to handle
    build pipelines, where computations can take time, and where
    seeing the live outputs of the computation is as useful as the
    final step (think of live-logs of long-running builds).

    The {!core} of [Datakit_ci] are {{!Term}term}combinators to
    describe the composition of long-running computation jobs, with an
    attached, individual {{!Output}output} (which can be
    {{!livelogs}live}). A project {{!config}configuration} tied
    together a collection of job description and a simple description
    for the {{!web}web} interface, whose access is granted using
    {{!acl}ACLs}.
